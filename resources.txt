fresh-MERN uses https://dev.to/pacheco/my-fullstack-setup-node-js-react-js-and-mongodb-2a4k as its base
  for the new ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined look at: https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/issues/161
  mongoose@6 has a transitive dependency on whatwg-url which is causing the error
  fix? = use an older version of mongoose (cough)

How do I give creators credit in my work?

If you choose to give creator credit to download an icon for free, then you need to follow these requirements:
The format should be “Icon name” by Creator Name, from the Noun Project. The icon name must be hyperlinked to 
the original source. If you can’t hyperlink in the medium you’re using the icon, then type out thenounproject.com 
as the source. This attribution must be listed next to the icon, below the icon, or somewhere on the project you 
create to properly reference the icon. To make it easier, free downloads include a line of text with the creator 
credit. However, if you would like to credit the creator in a different way or are using the icon in a different 
medium, you can copy the line of text and place it where it's relevant. Please see medium-specific credit 
requirements for more information.
Example 1: “Tree” icon by Edward Boatman from the Noun Project.
Example 2: “Tree” icon by Edward Boatman, from thenounproject.com.
