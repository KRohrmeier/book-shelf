- remember to STOP and START your server after making changes
  (did you try turning it off and on again?)

- for reasons known only to computers, sometimes you didn't do anything wrong and old
  info just got stuck. You'll need to stop the server and the app, walk away, then come 
  back and start it all up again at which point it will work. Because.

- No, I still don't know how to connect json backend so that I can modify the json from 
  the app. I can read the json in. But appending to a json file doesn't work like appending 
  to a text file.

- ^^ json-server is how you do that! F-yeah! 
  Well, for demoing, anyway.

- add json-server to dev dependencies
  - create a db.json file in root folder
  - can use curl commands to POST, like: curl -d '{"item":"rice"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST http://localhost:3333/list
